# Blazor And Fluxor State Machine CRUD Application

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with **Blazor**, **Fluxor**, and **MudBlazor**. It uses Fluxor for state management, providing predictable state handling 
and efficient state updates, and MudBlazor for UI components, offering a Material Design-inspired user experience.

## Features

- **Fluxor State Management**: Centralized, predictable state using Fluxor, supporting actions, effects, reducers, and selectors.
- **MudBlazor UI Components**: Elegant and responsive Material Design components.
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage a list of items with functionality to create, read, update, and delete records.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses a mock backend to simulate CRUD operations.
